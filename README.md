## Deployment Guide

This guide will help you set up Git and deploy the website to GitHub Pages.

### Setting Up Git

1. **Configure Git** - First, set up your Git identity:
   ```
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```

2. **Initialize Git Repository** (if not already done):
   ```
   git init
   ```

3. **Add files to Git**:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

4. **Make your first commit**:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit for Grey 18 Studios website"
   ```

### Connecting to GitHub

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
   - Name your repository (e.g., "grey18studios")
   - Keep it public if you want to use the free GitHub Pages
   - Do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Connect your local repository to GitHub**:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/grey18studios.git
   ```

3. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

#### Option 1: Deploy from main branch (simplest)

1. **Go to your repository settings**:
   - Click on "Settings" in your GitHub repository
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "master branch" or "main branch"
   - Click "Save"

2. **Access your deployed website**:
   - Your site will be published at `https://yourusername.github.io/grey18studios/`
   - GitHub will show you the URL in the GitHub Pages section

#### Option 2: Deploy using GitHub Actions (more control)

1. **Create a GitHub Actions workflow file**:
   - Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your project
   - Create a file named `deploy.yml` inside that directory

2. **Add the following content to deploy.yml**:
   ```yaml
   name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

   on:
     push:
       branches: [ master ]  # Or 'main' depending on your default branch name
     workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual triggering

   jobs:
     build-and-deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
           uses: actions/checkout@v2

         - name: Deploy üöÄ
           uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@4.1.4
           with:
             branch: gh-pages  # The branch the action should deploy to
             folder: .  # The folder the action should deploy
   ```

3. **Push the workflow file to GitHub**:
   ```
   git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   git commit -m "Add GitHub Pages deployment workflow"
   git push
   ```

4. **Configure GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "gh-pages branch"
   - Click "Save"

### Updating Your Website

1. **Make changes to your local files**

2. **Commit and push changes**:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push
   ```

3. **Automatic deployment**:
   - GitHub will automatically deploy your changes
   - For Option 1, changes will appear after pushing to main/master
   - For Option 2, the GitHub Action will run and deploy your changes

### Domain Setup (Optional)

1. **Purchase a domain name** from a registrar (like Namecheap, GoDaddy, Google Domains)

2. **Add a custom domain in GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section
   - Enter your domain name in the "Custom domain" field
   - Click "Save"

3. **Configure DNS records**:
   - Go to your domain registrar's DNS settings
   - Add these records:
     - A record pointing to GitHub's servers:
       - `185.199.108.153`
       - `185.199.109.153`
       - `185.199.110.153`
       - `185.199.111.153`
     - CNAME record:
       - Name: www
       - Value: yourusername.github.io

### Tips for Successful Deployment

- Make sure your website uses relative paths for all resources
- Use HTTPS links for any external resources (fonts, libraries, etc.)
- Test your website locally before pushing changes
- Check the GitHub Actions tab if using Option 2 to troubleshoot deployment issues
- GitHub Pages can take a few minutes to update after pushing changes

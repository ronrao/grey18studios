# Instructions for Pushing Your Website to GitHub

Follow these steps to create a GitHub repository and push your website:

## 1. Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/
2. Sign in to your GitHub account (or create one if you don't have one)
3. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner, then select "New repository"
4. Enter a name for your repository (e.g., "grey-18-studio")
5. Add a description (optional)
6. Choose Public or Private visibility
7. Leave "Initialize this repository with a README" UNCHECKED
8. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands to connect your existing repository.
Follow the "push an existing repository from the command line" section.

Run these commands in your terminal (replace YOUR-USERNAME and REPO-NAME with your GitHub username and repository name):

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Example:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/grey18studio/grey-18-studio.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Verify Your Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPO-NAME
2. You should see all your files in the repository
3. Make sure the portfolio files are there:
   - portfolio.html
   - portfolio-standalone.js
   - portfolio-dedicated.css

## Committing Future Changes

After making changes to your website, use these commands to update GitHub:

```
git add .                        # Add all changed files
git commit -m "Your message"     # Commit with a descriptive message
git push                         # Push to GitHub
```

## Important Notes About the Portfolio Page

Remember that the portfolio page is now set up with dedicated styling and JavaScript to ensure it won't be affected by future changes to the website. When making updates:

1. Don't directly modify portfolio-standalone.js or portfolio-dedicated.css unless you specifically want to change the portfolio functionality.
2. If adding new styles to the main stylesheet, be aware they won't override the portfolio page's dedicated styles.
3. The portfolio page should continue to work correctly even if you make significant changes to other parts of the website.
